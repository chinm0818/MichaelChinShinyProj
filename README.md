# Problem statement (Business Case):
NYC has published a dataset detailing all information on oil boilers throughout NYC, including expected year of furnace retirement. 
Knowing when and where these furnaces expire can be used by gas utilities to focus their efforts in assisting in a transition to gas, rather than reliance on lighter oil, thus increasing their overal sales in gas resources. 

# Goal of App:
Easily visualize where oil furnaces are due for decommissioning and when they are expected to happen

##What questions do we want to answer with this data set?
1. Where are these boilers located
2. When where they installed
3. How much fuel do they consume?
4. How much money worth of fuel is consumed?
5. When are they due to being replaced?
6. Who is reponsible for supplying gas if and when these boilers are replaced?
