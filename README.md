# Shiny app for NYC_oil project (serverside)
# Problem statement (Business Case):
# Goal of App:

##What questions do we want to answer with this data set?
#1. Where are these boilers located
#2. When where they installed
#3. How much fuel do they consume?
#3a. How much money worth of fuel is consumed?
#4. When are they due to being replaced?
#5. Who is reponsible for supplying gas if and when these boilers are replaced?

## Main Thesis: NYC has dates set to phase out thousands of boilers in nyc between 2010 and 2040.
## Each burns hundreds of thousands of oil worth of btus a year. 
## knowing when and where these units are being phased out would be useful in planning efforts to switch to gas units 
## no 4 and no 6 are dirty burining oils. no 6 was to be phased out 2015
## all burners are mandated to be on no 2 or nat gas by 2030
